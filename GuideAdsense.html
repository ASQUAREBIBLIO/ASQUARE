                                Google has operated an online advertising intermediation platform called 'Google AdSense',  
                                which delivers Google ads on the websites or the blogs of publishers. Over years, 
                                Google has developed a different online advertising intermediation services, including 
                                AdSense For Search (AFS), AdSense For Content (AFC), AdSense For Domains, AdSense For 
                                Mobile Applications (AdMob) and AdSense For Shopping (AFSh).

                                Google shares the revenue generated by Google search ads between it and publishers. 
                                Publishers receive a Traffic Acquisition Cost (TAC) from Google, which is the 
                                percentage of the revenue generated by users clicks on the search ads shown on the 
                                publisher's websites or blogs.

                                        The content-based advertisements can be targeted at users with certain interests 
                                        or contexts. The targeting can be CPC (cost per click) or CPM (cost per thousand 
                                        impressions) based, the only significant difference in CPC and CPM is that with 
                                        CPC targeting, earnings are based on clicks while CPM earnings recently are 
                                        actually based not just per views/impression but on a larger scale, per thousand 
                                        impressions, therefore driving it from the market, which makes CPC ads more 
                                        common.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There are various ad sizes available for content ads. The ads can be simple text, 
                                        image, animated image, flash video, video, or rich media ads. At most ad sizes, 
                                        users can change whether to show both text and multimedia ads or just one of 
                                        them. As of November 2012, a grey arrow appears beneath AdSense text ads for 
                                        easier identification. Google made a policy update regarding the number of ads 
                                        per page, the three ads per page limit has been removed.

                                        AdSense for search allows publishers to display ads relating to search terms on 
                                        their site and receive 51% of the revenue generated from those ads. AdSense 
                                        custom search ads can be displayed either alongside the results from an AdSense 
                                        Custom Search Engine or alongside internal search results through the use of 
                                        Custom Search Ads. Custom Search Ads are only available to "white-listed" 
                                        publishers. Although the revenue share from AdSense for Search (51%) is lower 
                                        than from AdSense for Content (68%) higher returns can be achieved due to the 
                                        potential for higher Click Through Rates.

                                    <p>
                                        AdSense for video allows publishers with video content (e.g., video hosting 
                                        websites) to generate revenue using ad placements from Google's extensive 
                                        advertising network. The publisher is able to decide what type of ads are shown 
                                        with their video inventory. Formats available include linear video ads 
                                        (pre-roll or post-roll), overlay ads that display AdSense text and display ads 
                                        over the video content, and the TrueView format.[17] Publishers can also display 
                                        companion ads - display ads that run alongside video content outside the player. 
                                        AdSense for video is for publishers running video content within a player and 
                                        not for YouTube publishers.

                                        Link units are closely targeted to the interests of your users. Because users 
                                        directly interact with the ad unit, they may be more interested in the ads they 
                                        eventually see.
                                    </p>

                                        AdSense publishers are paid for clicks on the ads that are linked from link unit 
                                        topics, not for clicks on the initial topics themselves. The ads on the linked 
                                        page are pay-per-click Google ads similar to those shown in regular AdSense ad 
                                        units.

                                Google uses its technology to serve advertisements based on website content, the user's 
                                geographical location, and other factors. Those wanting to advertise with Google's 
                                targeted advertisement system may enroll through Google Ads. AdSense has become one of 
                                the most popular programs specializing in creating and placing banner and responsive 
                                ads on websites and blogs. Responsive ads adjust themselves based upon user's device 
                                size. These advertisements are less intrusive and the content of the advertisements is 
                                often relevant to the website. Many websites use AdSense to make revenue from their 
                                web content (website, online videos, online audio content, etc.), and it is the most 
                                popular advertising network. AdSense has proved particularly useful for generating 
                                advertising revenue for small websites that do not have sufficient resources or other 
                                major sources of revenue. To display contextually relevant advertisements on a website, 
                                webmasters place a brief Javascript code on the website's pages. Websites that are 
                                content-rich have been very successful with this advertising program, as noted in a 
                                number of publisher case studies on the AdSense website. Google has removed the policy 
                                of limiting AdSense ads to three ads per page. Now, AdSense publishers can place several 
                                AdSense ads on a page given there is sufficient content on a webpage. According to 
                                Google guidelines on ensuring proper ad placement, advertising and promotional 
                                material should not exceed page content.

                                Some webmasters put significant effort into maximizing their AdSense income. They do this 
                                mainly by following[8] best practices:

                                    They do not try methods that encourage users to click ads. Google prohibits 
                                    webmasters from using phrases like "Click on my AdSense ads" to increase click 
                                    rates. The phrases accepted are "Sponsored Links" and "Advertisements".

                                The source of all AdSense income is the Ads program, which in turn has a complex 
                                pricing model based on a Vickrey second price auction. AdSense requires an advertiser 
                                to submit a sealed bid (i.e., a bid not observable by competitors). Additionally, for 
                                any given click received, advertisers only pay one bid increment above the second-highest 
                                bid. Google currently shares 68% of revenue generated by AdSense with content network 
                                partners, and 51% of revenue generated by AdSense with AdSense for Search partners. 
                                On June 18, 2015, Google announced rebranding of AdSense with a new logo.

                    <div class="container" id="container">

                            <h1>HOW IT WORKS ?</h1>
                            <p>
                                The webmaster who wishes to participate in AdSense inserts the AdSense JavaScript code 
                                into a webpage.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Each time this page is visited by an end user (e.g., a person surfing the Internet), the 
                                JavaScript code uses inlined JSON to display content fetched from Google's servers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For contextual advertisements, Google's servers use a web cache of the page created by 
                                its Mediabot "crawler" to determine a set of high-value keywords. If keywords have been 
                                cached already, advertisements are served for those keywords based on the Ads bidding 
                                system.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For website-targeted advertisements, the advertiser chooses the page(s) on which to 
                                display advertisements, and pays based on cost per mille (CPM), or the price advertisers 
                                choose to pay for every thousand advertisements displayed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For referrals, Google adds money to the advertiser's account when visitors either 
                                download the referred software or subscribe to the referred service. The referral 
                                program was retired in August 2008.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Search advertisements are added to the list of results after the visitor/user performs 
                                a search.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because the JavaScript is sent to the Web browser when the page is requested, it is 
                                possible for other website owners to copy the JavaScript code into their own webpages. To protect against this type of fraud, AdSense publishers can specify the pages on which advertisements should be shown. AdSense then ignores clicks from pages other than those specified.
