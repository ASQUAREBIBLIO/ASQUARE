                                Affiliate Marketing is a way to earn money by selling a brand's products. 
                                As a marketer, you have no inventory and work for commission. Generally, 
                                affiliate marketers receive payment when a consumer they referred buys a 
                                product or service or completes a specific task.
                            </p>

                                It also means that you'll have the opportunity to make a passive income 
                                by selling products that isn't yours. The more you sell, the more you 
                                earn.<br>
                                Your overall success requires building relantionships that rely on three 
                                distinct parties:

                                    As we've seen, affiliate marketers generally make money when they sell

                                    You can break down affiliate commission into three separate categories 
                                    that work together to ensure you get paid:
                                    <li>1. Payment Plans</li>
                                    <li>2. Proven Wins</li>
                                    <li>3. Payment Systems</li>

                                To start an affiliate marketing, here's a five-step method you should know 
                                in order to build your online audience:
                            </p>

                                        Finding your niche is one of the most crucial parts of starting your 
                                        affiliate marketing efforts. The wrong niche will make it harder to sell, 
                                        and the right niche will make it easier.
                                    </p>

                                        You should keep in mind that finding the right affiliate products to sell 
                                        isn't always about fun. It's about profit.<br>
                                        So to start assessing demand for a product, the best place to go into is 
                                        <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a>. This tells you how often Google users 
                                        search for a particular topic on a 0-100 scale. It also gives you a regional 
                                        breakdown, and some suggested topics as well.

                                            <p>
                                                As you can see, there are usually quite a few options to choose from. 
                                                You'll have the product's title, a short description, and then some 
                                                additional information that helps inform your decision.<br>
                                                Here's a closer view of one such breakdown:
                                            </p>
                                            <div class="img">
                                                <article>
                                                    <img src="images/ClickBankProduct.png">
                                                </article>
                                            </div>
                                            <p>
                                                In this case, you're given the average commission per sale, a 
                                                breakdown of the niche the product is in, and a few different links 
                                                to the merchant's website. Use these to conduct further research and 
                                                see if you want to promote the product.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Once you find the offer you want to promote, the rest of the process 
                                                is simple. Just click the Promote button on the page, and then copy 
                                                and paste the URL from the screen.
                                            </p>

                                                As an eBay affiliate, you'll be working directly with eBay and their 
                                                products. While you'll be working to a small degree to help sellers, 
                                                the primary relantionship is between you an eBay.

                                                As a bonus, eBay doesn't require you to work with them exclusively. 
                                                You can be an eBay affiliate and still work with other merchants and 
                                                programs to make additional income.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                To get started, you'll need to <a href="https://partner.ebay.com/campaign-promo-signup/eBay-Partner-Network.brand">Apply to join</a> their

                                            </p>
                                            <div class="img">

                                            <p>
                                                Once you sign in with your account, you'll be prompted to verify a 
                                                few pieces of information, select your country of residence, and 
                                                then you'll be done.<br>
                                                Now all you have to do is find products, generate your affiliate
                                                link, and start promoting.   
                                            </p>
                                            <div class="img">

                                            <p>
                                                You'll then be given your affiliate link, which you can use in your 
                                                own content.<br>
                                                The second way is even faster, but it requires you to install a 
                                                Bookmarklet icon in your Bookmarks Bar. That may sound confusing, 
                                                but it's pretty simple.<br>
                                                All you have to do is find the icon in your eBay dashboard and then 
                                                drag it to your Bookmarks bar.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                Once you've added it to your bookmarks bar, all you have to do is 
                                                click that bookmark when you've found an item on eBay that you want 
                                                to promote.<br>
                                                It will generate a URL for you, which you can then add to your blog, 
                                                ads, or social media.

                                                You can also shorten this link with amzn.to, which may be a good 
                                                idea if you intend to share the full link. Shorter links look better 
                                                and will be less confusing depending on the platform you use.
