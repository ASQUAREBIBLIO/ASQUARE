                                Google AdSense is a program run by Google through which website publishers in the Google 
                                Network of content sites serve text, images, video, or interactive media advertisements 
                                that are targeted to the site content and audience. These advertisements are administered,
                                sorted, and maintained by Google. They can generate revenue on either a per-click or 
                                per-impression basis. Google beta-tested a cost-per-action service, but discontinued it 
                                in October 2008 in favor of a DoubleClick offering (also owned by Google). In Q1 2014, 
                                Google earned US$3.4 billion ($13.6 billion annualized), or 22% of total revenue, through 
                                Google AdSense. AdSense is a participant in the AdChoices program, so AdSense ads 
                                typically include the triangle-shaped AdChoices icon. This program also operates on 
                                HTTP cookies. In 2021, over 38.3 million websites use AdSense.

                                        JavaScript is a high level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted 
                                        programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript 
                                        language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the 
                                        three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production; 
                                        the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern 
                                        webbrowsers without plug-ins. JavaScript is prototype-based with 
                                        first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, 
                                        supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming 
                                        styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and 
                                        regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking,
                                        storage or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host 
                                        environment in which it is embedded.

                                    PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. It was 
                                    originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP 
                                    reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood 
                                    for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: 
                                    Hypertext Preprocessor.
                                </p>

                                    PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as 
                                    a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web 
                                    server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code –which may be any type 
                                    of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data– would form the whole or part 
                                    of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, 
                                    and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the 
                                    generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming 
                                    tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and 
                                    robotic drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command 
                                    line.

                                    The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released 
                                    under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web 
                                    servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.

                                    The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 
                                    2014, with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other 
                                    implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal 
                                    PHP specification.

                                    MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is 
                                    a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", 
                                    the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes 
                                    data into one or more data tables in which data types may be related to each other; 
                                    these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language programmers use to create, 
                                    modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access 
                                    to the database. In addition to relational databases and SQL, an RDBMS like MySQL 
                                    works with an operating system to implement a relational database in a computer's 
                                    storage system, manages users, allows for network access and facilitates testing 
                                    database integrity and creation of backups.

                                    MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public 
                                    License, and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses. MySQL was 
                                    owned and sponsored by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun 
                                    Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation). In 2010, when Oracle acquired Sun, Widenius 
                                    forked the open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB.

                                    MySQL has stand-alone clients that allow users to interact directly with a MySQL 
                                    database using SQL, but more often, MySQL is used with other programs to implement 
                                    applications that need relational database capability. MySQL is a component of the 
                                    LAMP web application software stack (and others), which is an acronym for Linux, 
                                    Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python. MySQL is used by many database-driven web 
                                    applications, including Drupal, Joomla, phpBB, and WordPress. MySQL is also used 
                                    by many popular websites, including Facebook, Flick, MediaWiki, Twitter and YouTube.
