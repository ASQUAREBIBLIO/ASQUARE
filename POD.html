                            <h1>Print On Demand</h1>
                            <p>
                                Print on demand (POD) is a printing technology and business process in which book 
                                copies (or other documents) are not printed until the company receives an order, 
                                allowing prints of single or small quantities. While other industries established 
                                the build to order business model, "print on demand" could only develop after the 
                                beginning of digital printing, because it was not economical to print single 
                                copies using traditional printing technology such as letterpress and offset printing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Many traditional small presses have replaced their traditional printing equipment 
                                with POD equipment or contract their printing to POD service providers. Many academic 
                                publishers, including university presses, use POD services to maintain large backlists 
                                (lists of older publications); some use POD for all of their publications. Larger 
                                publishers may use POD in special circumstances, such as reprinting older, out-of-print 
                                titles, or for test marketing.

                            <p>
                                Print on demand with digital technology is a way to print items for a fixed cost per 
                                copy, regardless of the size of the order. While the unit price of each physical copy 
                                is greater than with offset printing, the average cost is lower for very small print 
                                jobs, because setup costs are much greater for offset printing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                POD has other business benefits besides lesser costs (for small jobs):
                                <li>
                                    Technical set-up is usually quicker than for offset printing.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Large inventories of a book or print material do not need to be kept in stock, 
                                    reducing storage, handling costs, and inventory accounting costs.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    There is little or no waste from unsold products.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Many publishers use POD for other printing needs other than books such as galley 
                                    proof, catalogs and review copies.
                                </li>

                            <p>
                                These advantages reduce the risks associated with publishing books and prints and can 
                                result in increased choice for consumers. However, the reduced risks for the publisher 
                                can also mean that quality control is less rigorous than usual.

                                <p>
                                    Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc. 
                                    for Windows and macOS. It was originally created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. 
                                    Since then, the software has become the industry standard not only in raster graphics 
                                    editing, but in digital art as a whole. The software's name has thus become a 
                                    generic trademark, leading to its usage as a verb (e.g. "to photoshop an image", 
                                    "photoshopping", and "photoshop contest") although Adobe discourages such use. 
                                    Photoshop can edit and compose raster images in multiple layers and supports masks, 
                                    alpha compositing and several color models including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color, 
                                    and duotone. Photoshop uses its own PSD and PSB file formats to support these 
                                    features. In addition to raster graphics, Photoshop has limited abilities to edit 
                                    or render text and vector graphics (especially through clipping path for the latter), 
                                    as well as 3D graphics and video. Its feature set can be expanded by plug-ins; 
                                    programs developed and distributed independently of Photoshop that run inside it 
                                    and offer new or enhanced features.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Photoshop's naming scheme was initially based on version numbers. However, in 
                                    October 2002 (following the introduction of Creative Suite branding), each new 
                                    version of Photoshop was designated with "CS" plus a number; e.g., the eighth major 
                                    version of Photoshop was Photoshop CS and the ninth was Photoshop CS2. Photoshop 
                                    CS3 through CS6 were also distributed in two different editions: Standard and 
                                    Extended. With the introduction of the Creative Cloud branding in June 2013 (and in 
                                    turn, the change of the "CS" suffix to "CC"), Photoshop's licensing scheme was 
                                    changed to that of software as a service subscription model. Historically, Photoshop

                                    Adobe Illustrator is a vector graphics editor and design program developed and 
                                    marketed by Adobe Inc. Originally designed for the Apple Macintosh, development of 
                                    Adobe Illustrator began in 1985. Along with Creative Cloud (Adobe's shift to monthly 
                                    or annual subscription service delivered over the Internet), Illustrator CC was 
                                    released. The latest version, Illustrator 2022, was released on October 26, 2021, 
                                    and is the 25th generation in the product line. Adobe Illustrator was reviewed as 
                                    the best vector graphics editing program in 2018 by PC Magazine.

                                        <strong>Post regularly:</strong> Feast or famine won't keep your fans interested 
                                        in your content. If you can only post twice a week, make sure you 
                                        post twice every week. Ideally, you're going to want to work your 
                                        way up to posting several times per day.

                                        <strong>Use creative, relevant hashtags:</strong> Use a service like #TagsForLikes 
                                        µto help generate a list of the most popular, on-topic hashtags for 
                                        each of your posts. If you aren't using the right hashtags, you're 
                                        missing out on a huge opportunity to be discovered by potential 
                                        customers and other people interested in the things you're posting 
                                        about!

                                        <strong>Don't just use hashtags:</strong> Tagging is a smart way of categorizing 
                                        images, but don't skip over the description! Your picture says a 
                                        thousand words, but the description you write can be used to expand 
                                        on the story and dive deeper into the engagement you're building 
                                        with potential customers. National Geographic is a pro at this, 
                                        using its descriptions to complement the visual story being told 
                                        in each posted image. Perfect this tactic and you'll keep fans on 
                                        your posts longer, and eager to see what you're going to say next!
